    /// addition of the mineral. Nonetheless, the stipulated tolerance for
    /// verification of convergence would not recognize that the problem is
    /// slightly different, yielding a solution that is identical to the
    /// solution of the original problem. Mass conservation would thus not be
    /// accurate to the level of machine precision. To avoid that this more
    /// recently added control breaks existing codes, the default is false.
