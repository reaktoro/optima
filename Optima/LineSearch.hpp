//=================================================================================================
// NOTE
//
// The Newton steps in Optima are currently generated in a way that prevents
// line search operations in general. This is because some variables on the
// bounds may have been considered in the Newton step calculation (because
// stability analysis indicated that they could potentially further decrease
// the object function if detached from their bounds). However, it may happen
// that once we compute the Newton step, the step for a variable on a lower
// bound is negative, or the step for a variable on the upper bound is
// positive. This indicates that these variables should then indeed remain on
// their bounds (at least for this iteration). Thus, the computed Newton step
// vector must be zeroed out for these variables on the bounds, otherwise the
// Newton step would cause these bounds to be violated. When we do this
// alteration on the Newton step, we change its properties (e.g., conservative
// properties if the linear constraints are mass/mole balance constraints). In
// addition, the modified Newton step may no longer be a descent direction with
// respect to the square of the residual errors.
//
// Thus, proper line search operations will require a recomputation of Newton
// step assumming that all variables currently on the bounds should be ignored,
// regardless of what the stability analysis is telling.
