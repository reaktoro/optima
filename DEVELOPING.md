# Developing

To contribute to developing Optima, we have a structured developing mode to
have almost the same environment for everyone. Below we describe the workflow to develop
Optima. All the instructions below should be executed inside the project root directory.

## Guidelines for developing mode installation

### 1. `conda` environment

We use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to generate and manage environments.
Please follow the instructions therein to install it locally. We recommend you to install
`miniconda` configured for Python 3 (`miniconda3`).

### 2. Extending `conda` with `conda-devenv`

We use [conda-devenv](https://github.com/ESSS/conda-devenv) to extend `conda` capabilities
and define environment variables in developing mode. With `miniconda3` properly installed and running,
just execute in your console:

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge conda-devenv
```

The above command will install `conda-devenv` in your `miniconda3` base environment.

### 3. Creating an environment for Optima development

Now, we can create an environment to develop Optima, with all dependencies installed in this environment.
From your `miniconda3` base environment with `conda-devenv` installed, run the following in your console:

```console
$ conda devenv
```

After that, you will have a `conda` environment called `optima` properly configured. A successful installation
should display in your console the message:

```console
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate optima
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

### 4. Building and installing Optima

Activate `optima` conda environment with:

```console
$ conda activate optima
```

Then run in your console:

```console
$ cmake -P install
```

A successful installation will build Optima and install its Python bindings. If everything is fine, you are able
to execute the following in your console without errors:

```console
$ python -c 'import optima'
```

### 5. Testing Optima

At last, but importantly, you have to run the tests. Every contribution to the code should be tested. The `master`
branch should be always passing all the tests. With Optima and its Python bindings properly installed inside `optima`
conda environment, run in your console (in the project root directory):

```console
pytest . -n auto
```
